# Snake
Game "Snake"
This is a Snake game written in C++ without using object-oriented programming. I made this game according to the guide of the youtuber "itProger" https://youtu.be/6qaAZTwemXY?si=PqPYAKmOeb1cSVBq
To control the snake, you need to press the WASD
W - Up keys
S - Down
D - To the right
A - To the left
X - Exit the game
(You must have an English keyboard layout, otherwise nothing will work)
To speed up or slow down the snake's movement speed, change the value of the argument in the function: std::chrono::milliseconds(); on line 13
